The main objective of this repo is to create a website containing all basic elements of html.
By the end of this project I will have put in practice most concepts from basic html and good practices related to it, for example:
1. An index.html page which will work as a homepage for the complete website and will redirect to the other pages.
2. Use of hyperlinks.
3. Correct use of images and Gifs (if needed).
4. Use of tags for text importance such as STRONG and em (emphasis).
5. Good structure along the whole coding.
